# neural-network-design-of-HEA

This is the repository of the code and data needed for reproducing the results of the paper "Neural Network-Assisted Development of High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts: Decoupling Ligand and Coordination Effects", currently submitted to Matter.

To view the neural network design, please open main.py. To obtain its performance metrics or to obtain the parity plot, simply execute main.py. Please ensure tensorflow 2.0 has been properly installed prior to running the code.

To reproduce the figures for ligand and coordination effects, please run inference_ligand_effect.py and inference_coord_effect.py, respectively.
